# Telescope Simulated Annealing "Control File"
# The program will build telescope problems, solve them, and plot
# them according to the instructions on each line of this file.
# The meaning of each column is explained below.
#
# Ignore - A # at the beginning of the line will ignore that line.
#   This column is merely a convenient area to do so.
#
# PlotOnly - Do not run the optimization algorithms.  Plot only.
#
# CountPlotAll - Plot all saved states for this many instances (the
#   first indices automatically).
#
# CountAnimate - Save an animation for this many instances (again,
#   the first few indices).
#
# FirstIdx - The first index in this group.
#
# Count - How many indices are in this group.
#
# NumLocs - How many direction requests for each problem instance.
#   This is the "size" of the problem.
#
# NumEpochs – How many epochs the simulated annealing algorithm runs.
#
# VbEvery – Frequency (in epochs) of status updates on the console.
#
# CoolInit, CoolBase, CoolFlatEpochs - These control the method of
#   cooling.  The temperature is controlled by the formula
#       CoolInit * CoolBase^(current epoch / CoolFlatEpochs)
#   found in src/SimAnneal.h cooling::PiecewiseConstGeomCool.
#
# The cooling parameters and the number of epochs must be manually
# tuned for each problem size (NumLocs).

# Here is a sample line that will run fairly quickly:

# These next three lines helped find appropriate annealing settings:
#     ,          12,        ,            1,            1,        0,    24,      20,   10_000_000,  1_000_000,     0.5,    0.996,  25_000
#     ,          12,        ,            1,            1,       24,    24,      50,   25_000_000,  1_000_000,     1.0,    0.997,  25_000
#     ,          12,        ,            1,            1,       48,    24,     100,   50_000_000,  2_000_000,     1.0,    0.997,  25_000
# --------------------------------------------------
# Using the same settings as above, these three form a sort of test:
     ,          12,        ,            0,            1,   10_000,    24,      20,   10_000_000,  1_000_000,     0.5,    0.996,  25_000
     ,          12,        ,            0,            1,   10_024,    24,      50,   25_000_000,  1_000_000,     1.0,    0.997,  25_000
     ,          12,        ,            0,            1,   10_048,    24,     100,   50_000_000,  2_000_000,     1.0,    0.997,  25_000
